              <h2>Eddia Rosario</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Eddia Rosario and I am proud to be part of the Apex
                Advisor Group! I have been in the tax and accounting industry
                for over 11 years. I have managed large tax offices that
                generated over 1 million dollars in revenue, managed over 100
                tax preparers located all over the united states plus their
                satellite offices. With all this experience it has also allowed
                me to interact with thousands of tax clients with various
                scenarios, from tax audits, identity theft, amending tax
                returns, while providing financial education to my clients so
                they can be better prepared for their future. My goal now is to
                continue to provide and offer my expertise to our new Tampa
                location.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally my next level of evolution is to offer individuals
                the opportunity to become professional tax preparers, business
                owners, and see continued growth in the tax industry. I was a
                call center operations manager prior to becoming an entrepreneur
                with zero experience in this tax industry until a mentor reached
                out to me and said `You can do this!`. I decided to take a risk
                on myself and so happy that I made that decision 11 years ago.
                So my friend, if you are interested in a tax and accounting home
                or office business, I would love to extend my support and
                guidance to you as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                `Many of life`s failures are people who did not realize how
                close they were to success when they gave up`. There’s nothing
                worse than the regret that you could have kept going but chose
                not to; there’s no greater success than knowing that you pushed
                through and challenged yourself and earned your victory.
